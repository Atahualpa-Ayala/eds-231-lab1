Compare the distributions of word frequencies between the first
paragraph and headlines. Do you see any difference? Response: Yes, there
are differences in the distributions of frequencies of the word
``deforestation'' between the first paragraph and headlines. The
frequency of ``deforestation'' is be higher in the first paragraph
compared to the headlines. This could be due to the fact that headlines
are often limited in length and therefore may not include all of the key
details of the article. Additionally, headlines are typically crafted to
grab the reader's attention and may not necessarily reflect the full
scope of the article's content
